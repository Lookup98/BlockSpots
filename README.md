   ```bash
   git clone git@github.com:iagolirapasssos/Blockly-Highlighter.git
   ```
2. Open Chrome and navigate to `chrome://extensions/`.
3. Enable **Developer mode** in the top-right.
4. Click **Load unpacked** and select the extension‚Äôs folder.
5. Pin the extension icon to your toolbar for easy access.

## Permissions

The extension requests the following permissions:

* `activeTab`: On user action, grant temporary access to the active tab to highlight blocks.
* `scripting`: Inject scripts into the page when you click **Highlight** or **Clear**.
* Host permissions (in `manifest.json`):

  * `https://ai2.appinventor.mit.edu/*`
  * `https://creator.kodular.io/*`
  * Any additional Blockly-based URLs you wish to support.

These permissions ensure the extension only runs on specified Blockly workspaces and only when explicitly triggered by the user.
